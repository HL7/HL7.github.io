### Where to Start

On the left you'll see a list of useful documentation related to the core tools and repositories.

It is recommended that you explore the [Developing HL7 Core Libraries](/docs/core-libs/overview) section to get oriented with what purpose each individual project serves.

#### Useful Links

The main community chat for the FHIR project is hosted on [Zulip][Link-Zulip] and can be accessed by anyone. This is a great place to ask questions to other members of the FHIR community, and collaborate on projects.

Most of the core documentation not directly related to the codebase itself is located on the [Confluence][Link-Confluence] page.

All other community links, registries, and services are listed on the [fhir.org][Link-FhirOrg] website.
